## Introduction
This plugin is a wrapper for [corsairmi](https://github.com/notaz/corsairmi) which reads out monitoring information for Corsair RMi and HXi power supplies. It is now also a wrapper for [cpsumon](https://github.com/audiohacked/cpsumon) for AXi PSU's

Originally created by Realies, Modified by Fma965 for more accurate statistics, to match with the unraid dashboard styling and to add AXi support
